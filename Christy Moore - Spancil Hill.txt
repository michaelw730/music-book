Last night as I lay dreaming of pleasant days gone by
My mind being bent on rambling to Ireland I did fly.
I stepped on board of a vision and I followed with a will
And I shortly came to anchor at the cross of Spancil Hill.

And Delighted by the novelty, enchanted by the scene
Where in my early boyhood so often I had been
I thought I heard a murmur and I think that I hear it still,
It's the little stream of water that flows down Spancil Hill.

To amuse a passing fancy, I laid down on the ground.
Where all my school companions, and they shortly gathered round.
When we were home returning, oh we danced with bright good will
To Martin Moylan's music, at the cross at Spancil Hill.

It being on the twenty-third of June, the day before the fair,
When Ireland's sons and daughters in crowds assembled there
The young, the old, the brave and the bold, they came to sport and to kill,
There were curious combinations at the cross at Spancil Hill.

Then I went to see my old neighbours, to hear what they might say,
The old ones were all dead and gone, and the young ones turning grey
I met with the tailor Quigley, he's as brave as ever still,
Sure he used to mend my britches when I lived in Spancil Hill.

Then I paid a flying visit to my first and only love,
She's as white as any lily and she's gentle as a dove
She threw her arms around me, saying "Johnny, I love you still"
Ah she's Mack, the ranger's daughter, she's the pride of Spancil Hill

I dreamt I stooped and kissed her as in the days of yore
She said "Johnny you're only joking, as manyÂ´s the time before"
And The cock it crew in the morning, oh it crew both loud and shrill,
And I woke in California...many miles from Spancil Hill.
