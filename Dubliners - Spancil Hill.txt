Last night as I lay dreaming of pleasant days gone by
Me mind being bent on rambling to Ireland I did fly.
I stepped on board a vision and I followed with a will
til next I came to anchor at the cross in Spancil Hill.

It being on the twenty-third of June, the day before the fair,
When Ireland's sons and daughters and friends assembled there
The young, the old, the brave and the bold, came their duty to fulfil,
At the parish church in Clooney, a mile from Spancil Hill.

I went to see me neighbours, to see what they might say,
The old ones were all dead and gone, the young ones turning grey
But I met the tailor Quigley, he's as bold as ever still,
Ah he used to make my britches when I lived in Spancil Hill.

I paid a flying visit to my first and only love,
She's as white as any lily, gentle as a dove
And She threw her arms around me, saying "Johnny, I love you still"
Ah she's Nell, the farmer's daughter, and the pride of Spancil Hill

I dreamt I held and kissed her as in the days of yore
"Ah Johnny you're only joking, as manyÂ´s the time before"
Then cock he crew in the morning, he crew both loud and shrill,
And I woke in California, many miles from Spancil Hill.
